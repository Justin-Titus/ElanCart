# ElanCart

ElanCart is a robust and modern shopping cart application tailored for e-commerce platforms. It delivers a fast, intuitive, and responsive user experience, making it easy for customers to browse products, manage their cart, and complete purchases. The project leverages JavaScript for dynamic interactions, CSS for styling, and HTML for semantic structure. (If you add a Python backend, include backend docs and a requirements file as needed.)
